# DNA Analyzer System Project
# Description
DNA sequences are composed of four types of nucleotides; The nucleotides are marked A (Adenine), G (Guanine), C (Cytosine) and T (Thymine). A full DNA molecule usually consists of two strands, connected to each other in base-pair connections: As with Ts, and Cs with Gs The DNA Analyzer System load, analyze, manipulate and save DNA sequences.
